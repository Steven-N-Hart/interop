# Resources for technical standards, systems development, and interoperability

This resource serves as an entry point to topics related to standards and interoperability relevant to Pathology and Laboratory Medicine. It is not intended to be comprehensive.

## Technical standards

### LOINC

- Main site at Regenstrief: https://loinc.org/

#### Automated LOINC mapping

A number of efforts to provide automated or semi-automated approaches to ensuring consistent selection of LOINC identifiers across organizations and data sets have been described.

- Parr, et al. [Automated mapping of laboratory tests to LOINC codes using noisy labels in a national electronic health record system database](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30137378/). J Am Med Inform Assoc. 2018 Oct 1;25(10):1292-1300.

#### Criticisms of LOINC

Important criticisms regarding the real-world utility of LOINC have been raised. Some notable examples:
- [Stram, 2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31603714/): inconsistencies in the selection of LOINC identifiers for coagulation assays and cardiac markers were unreliable in a large survey of laboratories.

## Maintaining this document

- This document is composed using GitHub Flavored Markdown: https://github.github.com/gfm/
- Urls less then 40 characters or so should be displayed inline so that the hostname and full path is visible (eg, see the link to the GFM spec above); longer urls should be presented as a hyperlink using [Markdown syntax](https://github.github.com/gfm/#links).
- Please cite publications as a url to a PubMed record with (author, year) citations, eg ([Stram, 2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31603714/)) - doing so will allow us to generate a bibliography by scraping pubmed IDs from urls in this document.
- Maintainers: please make frequent, logical commits to facilitate the review process.

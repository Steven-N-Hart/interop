## Maintaining this document

- This document is composed using GitHub Flavored Markdown: https://github.github.com/gfm/
- Urls less then 40 characters or so should be displayed inline so that the hostname and full path is visible (eg, see the link to the GFM spec above); longer urls should be presented as a hyperlink using [Markdown syntax](https://github.github.com/gfm/#links).
- Please cite publications as a url to a PubMed record with (author, year) citations, eg ([Carter, 2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33328084/)) - doing so will allow us to generate a bibliography by scraping pubmed IDs from urls in this document.

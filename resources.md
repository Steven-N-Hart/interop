# Resources for technical standards, systems development, and interoperability

This resource serves as an entry point to topics related to standards and interoperability relevant to Pathology and Laboratory Medicine. It is not intended to be comprehensive. Instead, content here should highlight current and emerging topics likely to be of interest to the API community.

## Technical standards

### LOINC

- Main site at Regenstrief: https://loinc.org/

#### Automated LOINC mapping

A number of efforts to provide automated or semi-automated approaches to ensuring consistent selection of LOINC identifiers across organizations and data sets have been described.

- Parr, et al. (2018) [^parr_2018] describes "an automated machine learning pipeline that leverages noisy labels to map laboratory data to LOINC codes" using lab results in the VA data warehouse.

#### Criticisms of LOINC

Important criticisms regarding the real-world utility of LOINC have been raised. Some notable examples:

- Stram, et. al. (2020)[^stram-2020] described inconsistencies in the selection of LOINC identifiers for coagulation assays and cardiac markers in a large survey of laboratories.

### SNOMED
- Cancer Content to be used in eCCs
- Ongoing work to develop molecular concepts, eCC data field codes, and integration/coordination with LOINC for coverage of lab medicine concepts

#### HL7 Version 2.5.1 Implementation Guide: Laboratory Results Interface, Release 1 STU Release 3 - US Realm
- This guide provides guidance on how to communicate laboratory results in general from a (reference) Laboratoryâ€™s LIS to a system interested in lab results, e.g., EHR, Public Health, other Laboratory.  It covers general lab results, as well as specifications focused on microbiology, newborn dried bloodspot screening, and clinical genomics.

#### North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR) Standards for Cancer Registries Volume V: Pathology Laboratory Electronic Reporting, Version 5.0
- The goal of this document is to define data standards and guidelines to transmit cancer information from laboratories to cancer registries. It also provides guidelines for the implementation of these standards by pathology laboratories, vendors, and other groups. 
- Standards Process Maturity
- Implementation Maturity
- Adoption Level
- Federally required (yes/no, details)

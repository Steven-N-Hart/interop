# Resources for technical standards, systems development, and interoperability

The Technical Standards and Interoperability resources are created to express, discuss, and illustrate pressing issues of information exchange between clinical systems used in Pathology.
Digitized slides, AI algorithms, Data Exchange Interfaces, Dashboards and other types of visualization, workflow management systems in general greatly speed up the processing of data.
Converting data into information and assembling it at decision points to serve purposeful ends remains a challenge.

This resource serves as an entry point to topics related to standards
and interoperability relevant to Pathology and Laboratory Medicine. It
is not intended to be comprehensive. Instead, content here will
highlight current and emerging topics likely to be of interest to the
API community.

This site is maintained by the [Association for Pathology
Informatics](https://pathologyinformatics.org) as a project of the
Technical Standards Committee.

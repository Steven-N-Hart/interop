## Automated LOINC mapping

A number of efforts to provide automated or semi-automated approaches to ensuring consistent selection of LOINC identifiers across organizations and data sets have been described.

- Parr, et al. (2018) [^parr_2018] describes "an automated machine learning pipeline that leverages noisy labels to map laboratory data to LOINC codes" using lab results in the VA data warehouse.

## Criticisms of LOINC

Important criticisms regarding the real-world utility of LOINC have been raised. Some notable examples:

- Stram, et. al. (2020)[^stram-2020] described inconsistencies in the selection of LOINC identifiers for coagulation assays and cardiac markers in a large survey of laboratories.
